Apps DevOps is geared toward the product owner and dev team who not only want CI/CD but a complete set of software life cycle tools. 

### Features:
1. Dashboard shows real-time state of applications.
1. Apps self-register code files and Apps.DevOps tracks file and method changes to help you keep documentation current.
2. Instantly create low-code solutions, projects, injecting best-practice Front-End and Back-End custom components and snippets.
3. Create Stories, Scenarios and Functional Specs that are tied directly to and historically stay with your app's live code.
4. Create Test Plans, Tests and Test Steps that are run and asserted upon dynamically using back end unit testing and front end functional testing.
5. Leverage AppsJS to make your web site automatically testable using whatever framework you prefer (I prefer AppsJS :).
6. Schedule build and deploy using pre-build and post-deploy C# scripts.
7. Monitor apps usage using custom "Flow" objects.
8. Built-in service hub (Ocelot).
9. Built-in token authentication (Identity Server)
